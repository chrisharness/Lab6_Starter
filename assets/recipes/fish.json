This is a beautiful, elegant white wine sauce that will go with virtually any fish. The simple restaurant trick we deploy here is to mix in cold cubes of butter which makes the sauce glossy and satiny. It&#39;s a classic French technique called monter au beurre.Don&#39;t try this sauce with baked fish (make this Baked Fish with Lemon Cream Sauce instead). You need to pan fry because the fond left in the pan after pan frying dissolves into the sauce and adds flavour.","datePublished":"2021-08-16T15:56:23+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fish-in-white-wine-cream-sauce_95-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fish-in-white-wine-cream-sauce_95-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fish-in-white-wine-cream-sauce_95-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fish-in-white-wine-cream-sauce_95-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT12M","totalTime":"PT17M","recipeIngredient":["4   x 150g / 5oz white fish fillets (, skinless, boneless (I used snapper, Note 1))","1/2 tsp salt","1/4 tsp pepper","2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil","1  eschalot (, small, finely chopped (~1 1/2 tbs, Note 2))","1 1/4 cups white wine (, dry, not sweet or too woody (chardonnay is especially good, Note 3))","1 tsp lemon juice ((sub white wine vinegar))","1 tsp white wine vinegar ((sub more lemon))","1/8 tsp salt","1 pinch pepper","1 pinch white sugar","1 cup thickened/heavy cream","30g / 2 tbsp  unsalted butter (, cold, cut into 1cm / 1/3\" cubes)","2 tsp finely chopped parsley ((or chives))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Cook fish:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat oven to 50\u00b0C/120\u00b0F.
